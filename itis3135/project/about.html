                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Jordan Qualls, and I’ve been a makeup artist for the past 8 years. My journey began in middle and high school theater, where I found a creative outlet in character creation and special effects. After high school, I transitioned into professional makeup, booking weddings, proms, and gigs at my local theater, as well as working at haunted houses during Halloween. I further honed my skills by taking makeup classes at university and obtaining my Esthetics and Nail Tech licenses.</p>
                    <p>As a makeup artist, my specialties lie in special effects, prosthetic creation, and avant-garde high fashion looks. My ultimate dream is to take my craft to Fashion Week, showcasing my work on the world’s biggest stages. As a nail tech, my focus is on nail art and sculpting, and I aspire to be a published nail tech, creating stunning designs for celebrity events.</p>
                    <p>I’m passionate about bringing my creative visions to life through makeup and nails. I encourage fellow artists to never stop learning, to push their limits, and to embrace every new opportunity—because you never know where one chance could lead you to the next big thing.</p>
