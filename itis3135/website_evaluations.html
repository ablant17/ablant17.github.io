              <h3>Good Website - <a href="https://zodia-custody.com/">Zodia Custody</a></h3>
              <p>Zodia Custody is a digital asset custody service website that provides secure and institutional-grade solutions for managing cryptocurrency assets. The website presents its services clearly, focusing on trust, security, and regulatory compliance, while offering a clean and professional design that caters to its target audience of financial institutions.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: The website uses strong contrast between text and background, with dark fonts on light backgrounds and vice versa, ensuring all text is easily readable. Important elements, such as call-to-action buttons, stand out clearly from the surrounding content, guiding users toward key actions. </li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: Zodia Custody maintains consistent design patterns throughout the site, using the same fonts, colors, and button styles on every page. This repetition creates a cohesive visual identity, reinforcing the brand’s professionalism and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: The alignment is well-executed, with every element, from text blocks to images and forms, neatly organized. This clean alignment helps create a structured and orderly appearance, making the content easy to read and navigate without any confusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: he proximity principle is effectively applied, with related elements, such as service descriptions and supporting visuals, grouped closely together. There is sufficient spacing between different sections, allowing users to clearly distinguish between various content areas, reducing cognitive load and improving the user experience.</li>

              <h3>Bad Website - <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a></h3>
              <p>Lonely Planet is a popular travel guide website offering information about destinations, tips for travelers, and travel booking services. The site includes articles, photos, travel recommendations, and destination guides aimed at helping users plan trips..</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: In some areas, the contrast between text and background is poor, especially with light grey text on white backgrounds, making it difficult to read. Important links and buttons don’t stand out enough, which can make navigating the site more frustrating for users.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: While some elements like fonts and colors are used consistently, there are many inconsistencies across different pages. This lack of uniformity, such as varying layouts and button styles, creates a disjointed and less cohesive user experience. </li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Certain sections on the homepage and other pages feel cluttered and misaligned, with text, images, and advertisements overlapping or positioned awkwardly. This disorganization makes the page feel chaotic and less professional</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: The website’s layout often places unrelated content too close together, leading to visual confusion. Elements such as navigation links, articles, and ads are not clearly separated, making it harder for users to focus on relevant information.</li>
